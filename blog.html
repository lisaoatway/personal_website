        <h1>I'm glad this isn't my house</h1>

        <p>Last summer I went to see the band <span>Every Time I Die </span> play on an a rickety old ferry boat. As the band was about to start, they made an announcement to a group of sweaty, "adult" fans, "this boat is old, lets all be respectful". Approximately 3 songs into the set, the guitar player jumped off the stage, surfed over the crowd, and kicked out the ceiling tiles, while not missing a beat. It was like a raging highschool party that was so much fun, but you were so happy it wasnt at your house.
