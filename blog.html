        <h1>I'm glad this isn't my house</h1>

        <p>Last summer I went to see the band <span>Every Time I Die </span> play on an a rickety old ferry boat. As the band was about to start, they made an announcement, <span style="color:fuchsia;">"this boat is old as fuck, lets all be respectful".</span> Approximately 3 songs into the set, the bass player jumped off the stage, surfed over the crowd of sweaty man children, and kicked out the ceiling tiles, while not missing a beat. I still have yet to find anything that brings back that feeling of being both a raging teenager and a respectable adult at the same time.
